# IoT-Integrated Gas Leak Detection and Threat Zone Identification System

This project outlines an **IoT-integrated system for gas leak detection and threat zone identification**, designed to enhance safety measures in industrial environments such as gas refineries and chemical plants. The system leverages IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to provide real-time monitoring, precise threat zone mapping, and timely alerts.

## Features
- **Gas Leak Detection**: Real-time monitoring of harmful gases using strategically placed sensors.
- **Threat Zone Identification**: Detection and delineation of hazardous areas based on gas concentration, wind direction, and speed.
- **Severity Classification**: Categorization of threat zones into red (critical), orange (moderate), and yellow (low) levels.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Multiple alert mechanisms, including auditory alarms, visual signals, mobile notifications, and broadcast messages.
- **Emergency Services Integration**: Seamless communication with nearby emergency services (police, hospitals, rescue teams).

## System Architecture
The system comprises the following modules:
1. **Sensor Data Acquisition Module**: Collects real-time air quality data.
2. **Gas Detection Module**: Identifies gas leaks and analyzes harmful gas concentrations.
3. **Threat Zone Identification Module**: Determines the extent of hazardous areas.
4. **Threat Zone Classification Module**: Assigns severity levels to identified zones.
5. **Alerts Generating Module**: Sends alerts and evacuation instructions based on detected threats.
